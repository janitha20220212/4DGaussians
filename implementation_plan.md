# Explanation and Contribution Plan

The goal is to help a beginner programmer understand the changes made to the 4DGaussians codebase and provide a path to contribute these improvements to the original repository.

## User Review Required

> [!NOTE]
> I will be creating two new documentation files. Please let me know if you would like me to focus on any specific part of the code in more detail.

## Proposed Changes

### Documentation Component

#### [NEW] [CONTRIBUTOR_SUMMARY.md](file:///c:/Users/janit/OneDrive/Desktop/Janitha/IIT/FYP/4DGaussians%20-%20Copy/CONTRIBUTOR_SUMMARY.md)
- Explains the `mmcv` dependency fix in `render.py`.
- Explains the Blackwell GPU (SM 12.0/12.1) architecture support.
- Describes why these changes are valuable to the community.

#### [NEW] [GITHUB_CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md](file:///c:/Users/janit/OneDrive/Desktop/Janitha/IIT/FYP/4DGaussians%20-%20Copy/GITHUB_CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md)
- Step-by-step guide on Forking, Branching, Committing, and Pull Requests.
- Tips on writing a good Pull Request description.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- I will review the content of both files to ensure they are accurate, beginner-friendly, and technically sound.
- I will verify all file links in the documentation.
